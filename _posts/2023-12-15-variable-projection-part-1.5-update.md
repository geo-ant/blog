Announcing a major update of my article on the variable projection algorithm,
which you can find on this blog by [**following this link**](/blog/2020/variable-projection-part-1-fundamentals/).
The article now contains all the information you need to implement your own
VarPro library in a language of your choice.

I've decided not to move the original post since it would break all internal
and external links to it. The update lays the foundation for a future article
on variable projection for problems with multiple right hand sides. That one is
finally coming, after I had announced it  at the end of the previous article
roughly three years ago.
