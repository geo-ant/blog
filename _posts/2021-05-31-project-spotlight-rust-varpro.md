In the last months, I have been developing three crates for Rust. All of these crates are open source libraries that use different aspects of the language. The first crate is a numerics library, which emphasizes interfaces that are powerful but simple to use. The second one is a fluent coding library using mostly declarative macros and the third crate uses procedural macros to help with expressive assertions. For my next series of posts I am going to introduce these three crates and highlight a particular aspect of each one. First up is the `varpro` library.

# VarPro for Rust
The [varpro crate](https://crates.io/crates/varpro) is a library that allows nonlinear least squares fitting of separable model functions to data in one dimension. The library uses the Variable Projection (VarPro) algorithm, on which I wrote an [in depth article](/blog/2020/variable-projection-part-1-fundamentals/). The documentation of the crate goes into detail of how to use the crate (and what to use it for), so I won't repeat it all here. However, there is one feature I want to highlight because I am very happy with how it turned out.

## Design Goal: A Simple Interface

Variable Projection is about fitting a separable function to data[^notation]. A separable function $$\eta(t,\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{c}) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} c_j\phi_j(t,\boldsymbol{\alpha})$$ is a linear combination of nonlinear *model base functions* $$\phi_j(t,\boldsymbol{\alpha}).$$ The *model function* $$\eta(t,\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{c})$$ depends on the linear parameters $$\boldsymbol{c}$$, the nonlinear parameters $$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$, and the independent variable $$t$$. The model base functions, however, only depend on the nonlinear parameters $$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$$ and the independent variable $$t$$. The VarPro algorithm completely absolves the user from caring about the linear parameters. The user does not even have to provide initial guesses for the linear parameters. The core thing that the user *has* to provide is the set of base functions $$\phi_j(t,\boldsymbol{\alpha})$$ and their partial derivatives. So the main design goal for the interface of the library was to make the process of creating a set of base functions --and associated derivatives-- simple and safe. 

## Translating the Math to Rust

If we look at the mathematical notation of the functions $$\phi_j(t,\boldsymbol{\alpha})$$, it looks like this suggests a function signature like `Fn(Scalar,Vector)->Scalar`. But since we are dealing with a collection of one dimensional data, it makes sense to give the whole set of independent values at once. That means we give `t` as a vector of the independent values and have the function return a vector. This allows us to take advantage of batch operations on vector elements in the function implementation[^nalgebra]. So does that mean we use `Fn(Vector,Vector)->Vector` as the function signature? Not quite. Let me explain why.

Assume we have a model that depends on 2 nonlinear parameters $$\mu,\nu$$, which means $$\boldsymbol{\alpha}=(\mu,\nu)^T$$. Furthermore, we have 2 base functions like so $$\phi_1=\phi_1(t,\mu,\nu)$$ and $$\phi_1=\phi_2(t,\nu)$$. We can see that the base functions each depend on their own subset of the total model parameters. Different functions might depend on different subsets of parameters. Furthermore, the number of parameters can vary from function to function. So instead of making model functions take their parameters as a vector, I decided I would make a variadic function interface that allows me to pass the functions in a way that is intuitive and easy to read for the implementor. Rust --at the time of writing-- does not have variadic functions, so I had to use a trick that I explained in this [previous post](/blog/2021/rust-traits-and-variadic-functions/).

Eventually, I ended up with a simple interface for building a model function from a set of base functions with derivatives. I can implement the functions
$$\phi_1=\phi_1(t,\mu,\nu)$$ and $$\phi_1=\phi_2(t,\nu)$$ in Rust like so [^types]:

```rust
fn phi1(t: &Vector, mu : Scalar, nu: Scalar) -> Vector {
    // calculations
}
fn phi2(t: &Vector, nu : Scalar) -> Vector {
    // calculations
}
```
We have to provide the partial derivatives for each function. For our example that would be $$\partial/\partial_\mu \phi_1$$, $$\partial/\partial_\nu \phi_1$$, and $$\partial/\partial_\nu \phi_2$$. We could implement those like so:
```rust
fn phi1_dmu(t: &Vector, mu : Scalar, nu: Scalar) -> Vector {
    // calculations
}
fn phi1_dnu(t: &Vector, mu : Scalar, nu: Scalar) -> Vector {
    // calculations
}
fn phi2_dnu(t: &Vector, nu : Scalar) -> Vector {
    // calculations
}
```
Now we can build our model function set with these base functions and their derivatives. We do that by using the `SeparableModelBuilder` like so
```rust
let model =
   SeparableModelBuilder::new(&["mu", "nu"]) //(1)
  .function(&["mu", "nu"], phi1)             //(2)
  .partial_deriv("mu", phi1_dmu)             //(3)
  .partial_deriv("nu", phi1_dnu)             //(4)
  .function(&["nu"], phi2)                   //(4)
  .partial_deriv("nu", phi2_dnu)             //(5)
  .build()                                   //(6)
  .unwrap();
``` 
In line (1) we are creating an empty model with the parameters $$\boldsymbol{\alpha}=(\mu,\nu)^T$$. In line (2) we are adding the function `phi1` and telling the model which parameters this function depends on (ordered left to right). In line (3) and (4) we are providing the partial derivatives of the function `phi1` for each parameter individually. After that, we are repeating the process for `phi2`. The base functions can be any callables with the correct signature, including lambdas.

## Benefits of the Interface Design

This interface design might not look like much, but I like it a lot for two main reasons: Firstly, it makes the code more expressive. If we had taken the nonlinear parameter as a vector, then we would have to assign meaning to the parameters inside the function body instead of the function signature, i.e.
```rust
fn phi1_dmu(t: &Vector, alpha : &Vector) -> Vector {
    let mu = alpha[0];
    let nu = alpha[1];
    // calculations
}
```
The variadic interface helps e.g. when *adding* another parameter to our function, because the number of string arguments will not match the number of nonlinear parameters in the function signature. This could not have been checked when passing `alpha` as a vector. 

Secondly, the variadic implementation adds safety. How? Well, the assignments to `mu` and `nu` might fail, because the vector does not have enough elements. So we would have to deal with that error somehow. With the variadic interface we can check (at runtime) if the number of nonlinear function arguments matches the number of string arguments and otherwise raise an error. After that we can always be certain that we are passing the correct number of arguments.

# Conclusion
This concludes my spotlight on the varpro crate. I am pretty happy with how the interface turned out, because it allows me some compile time sanity checks and a lot of runtime error checking. I think it is pretty straightforward to build model functions using the *faux*-variadic solution I mentioned earlier. If you like to use `varpro` for your nonlinear fitting needs, [give it a try](https://crates.io/crates/varpro).



# Endnotes
[^nalgebra]: I used the [nalgebra](https://www.nalgebra.org/) package to take care of linear algebra.
[^notation]: In my article on varpro, I used the notation $$f(\boldsymbol{\alpha},t)$$, but to be consistent with how I implemented it in the library (for reasons that will become apparent later), I'll pull $$t$$ in the front and use  $$f(t,\boldsymbol{\alpha})$$ notation here. This changes nothing semantically.
[^types]: Here `Vector` is an appropriate column vector type from nalgebra and `Scalar` is an appropriate scalar type. E.g. `type Vector = nalgebra::DVector<f64>` and `type Scalar = f64`.
