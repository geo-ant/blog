About three years ago, I announced in my [previous article](/blog/2020/variable-projection-part-1-fundamentals/)
on variable projection, that I would write a follow up about VarPro with
multiple right hand sides. This is it. Global fitting with multiple
right hand sides is an application where VarPro shines because it can
bring significant computational savings. Let's dive right in.

# What is Global Fitting?

_Global fitting_ is a term that I came across back when I was working in
fluorescence lifetime imaging, see e.g. (Warren2013). I am not
sure whether it is a widely used term, but the data analysis software
OriginLab Origin<sup>&reg;</sup> also seems to use it, and [their definition](https://www.originlab.com/doc/Tutorials/Fitting-Global)
is quite instructive[^slight-changes]:

> The term "global fitting" generally refers to simultaneous curve fitting operations
> performed on multiple right hand sides. Because right hand sides remain distinct, they may or
> may not "share" parameter values during the fit process. When a parameter is shared,
> a single parameter value is calculated for all right hand sides. When a parameter is
> not shared, a separate parameter value is calculated for each right hand side. 

The topic of this article is global fitting of a vector valued function $$\boldsymbol f \in \mathbb{R}^m$$
to $$S \in \mathbb{N}$$ vector valued right hand sides $$\boldsymbol y_s \in \mathbb{R}^m$$, $$s = 1,\dots,S$$.
We are concerned only with fitting certain kinds of functions, so called _separable_ model
functions. Those are functions $$\boldsymbol f$$ which can be written as the linear combination of $$n$$
nonlinear functions. For our problem, we will assume that the nonlinear parameters
are shared across all the members of the datasets, while the linear coefficients are allowed to
vary between members. I'll give a more formal description soon.

The fitting problem as stated above will allow us to use VarPro to its full potential and reap potentially massive
computational benefits. However, not every fitting problem will fit this bill.
Firstly, we need a model function that is truly separable. Secondly,
we need a problem where it is justified to assume that the nonlinear parameters are
shared across the dataset, while the linear coefficients are not. Fluorescence 
lifetime imaging is an example of such a problem[^lifetimes]. 

# VarPro: A Quick Recap

Since this article is a follow up of my [previous article](/blog/2020/variable-projection-part-1-fundamentals/),
I assume that you, kind reader, are familiar with it. I'll use the same notation
as before, so that its easy to go back and forth between the articles and
I'll keep repetition to a minimum.

In the last article, we were concerned with least squares fitting a vector valued,
separable model function $$\boldsymbol{f}$$, which is written as a linear combination
of nonlinear basis functions
 
$$
\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{\alpha},\boldsymbol{c}) = \boldsymbol{\Phi}(\boldsymbol\alpha)\boldsymbol{c} \in \mathbb{R}^m \label{def-f} \tag{0}
$$

to a vector of observations $$\boldsymbol{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m$$. Here $$\boldsymbol \alpha$$
are the nonlinear parameters of the model function, while $$\boldsymbol c$$ are the linear
coefficients. The vector $$\boldsymbol y$$ is the (single) right hand side of
our problem.

Specifically we were concerned with finding $$\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in \mathbb{R}^q$$
and $$\boldsymbol c \in \mathbb{R}^n$$ such that the weighted sum of 
squared residuals $$\rho_{WLS}$$ is minimized

$$\begin{eqnarray}
&\min_{\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol c}& \rho_{WLS}(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol c) \label{min-rho-single} \tag{1} \\
\rho_{WLS}(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol c) &:=& \lVert \boldsymbol{r_w}(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol c) \rVert^2_2 \label{def-rwls} \tag{2}\\
\boldsymbol r_w(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol c) &:=& \boldsymbol W (\boldsymbol y - \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol c)) \\
&=& \boldsymbol y_w - \boldsymbol \Phi_w(\boldsymbol \alpha) \boldsymbol c \label{def-rw} \tag{3} \\
\boldsymbol \Phi_w &:=& \boldsymbol W \boldsymbol \Phi \label{def-phiw} \tag{4} \\
\boldsymbol y_w &:=& \boldsymbol W \boldsymbol y \label{def-yw} \tag{5},
\end{eqnarray}$$

where $$\boldsymbol W \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$$ is a weighting matrix. 
We learned that the magic of VarPro is to rewrite the
problem from a minimization over $$\boldsymbol \alpha$$ _and_ $$\boldsymbol c$$
to a minimization over the nonlinear parameters $$\boldsymbol \alpha$$ _only_:

$$ \boldsymbol r_w (\boldsymbol \alpha) = \boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w(\boldsymbol \alpha)} \boldsymbol y_w. \label{rw-P-y} \tag{6}$$

The [previous article](/blog/2020/variable-projection-part-1-fundamentals/) goes
into detail on how the _projection matrix_ $$\boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w(\boldsymbol \alpha)}$$,
which depends on $$\boldsymbol \Phi(\boldsymbol \alpha)$$ and $$\boldsymbol W$$, is calculated.
To minimize the squared sum of the residuals, we feed $$\boldsymbol r_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)$$
into a least squares solver of our choice, like e.g. the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
We are typically required to provide the Jacobian matrix $$\boldsymbol J(\boldsymbol \alpha)$$
of the residuals as well. It turns out, that we can calculate the $$k$$-th column
$$\boldsymbol j_k$$ of the Jacobian as

$$ \boldsymbol j_k = \frac{\partial \boldsymbol r_w}{\partial \alpha_k} = \frac{\partial\boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w(\boldsymbol \alpha)}}{\partial \alpha_k} \boldsymbol y_w, \label{jk} \tag{7}$$

where the expression for the derivative of the projection matrix is given in the
previous article. Now we have all the ingredients together to tackle the global
fitting problem. 

# Global Fitting with VarPro

In this section I'll follow the clear presentation of BÃ¤rligea and Hochstaffl
(Baerligea2023)[^baerligea-extension]. As I said above, this
article is concerned with fitting separable models to a dataset where the nonlinear
parameters are shared across the whole dataset, while the linear coefficients
are allowed to vary across the members of the set. Let's formalize this now. Our
dataset is an ordered set of vector valued right hand sides
$$\left\{\boldsymbol y_s \in \mathbb{R}^m | s=1,\dots,S\right\}$$.
We'll now collect the members of the dataset into a matrix:

$$\boldsymbol Y 
= \left(\begin{matrix}
\vert & & \vert \\
\boldsymbol y_1, & \dots, & \boldsymbol y_S \\
\vert & & \vert \\
\end{matrix}\right)
\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times S}. \label{def-Y} \tag{8}
$$

Since we allowed the linear coefficients to vary across the dataset,
each member has its own vector of linear coefficients $$\boldsymbol c_s$$. We
can also group those into a matrix

$$\boldsymbol C
= \left(\begin{matrix}
\vert & & \vert \\
\boldsymbol c_1, & \dots, & \boldsymbol c_S \\
\vert & & \vert \\
\end{matrix}\right)
\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times S}.\label{def-C} \tag{9}
$$

Finally, we can group the weighted residual vectors into a matrix:

$$\boldsymbol R_w
= \left(\begin{matrix}
\vert & & \vert \\
\boldsymbol r_{w,1}, & \dots, & \boldsymbol r_{w,S} \\
\vert & & \vert \\
\end{matrix}\right)
\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times S}, \label{def-Rmatrix} \tag{10}
$$

where

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol r_{w,s} &=& \boldsymbol W (\boldsymbol y_s - \boldsymbol \Phi(\boldsymbol \alpha) \boldsymbol c_s) \tag{11} \label{weighted-data}\\
 &=& \boldsymbol y_{w,s} - \boldsymbol \Phi_w(\boldsymbol \alpha) \boldsymbol c_s \\
\boldsymbol y_{w,s} &:=& \boldsymbol W \boldsymbol y_s 
\end{eqnarray}$$

This implies that the same weights are applied to each member of
the dataset. Note further, that $$\boldsymbol \alpha$$ and thus $$\boldsymbol \Phi_w(\alpha)$$ are the same
for each residual vector.

Our fitting problem now is to minimize the sum of squared residual vector 2-norms,
i.e. $$\sum_s \lVert r_{w,s} \rVert_2^2$$, which we can write in matrix form like so: 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
&\min_{\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol C}& \rho_{WLS}(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol C) \label{min-rho-mrhs} \tag{12} \\
\rho_{WLS}(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol C) &:=& \lVert \boldsymbol R_w(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol C) \rVert_F^2 \label{redef-rho} \tag{13} \\
\boldsymbol R_w(\boldsymbol \alpha, \boldsymbol C) &:=& \boldsymbol W (\boldsymbol Y - \boldsymbol \Phi \boldsymbol C \label{def-residual-matrix} \tag{14}) \\
&=& \boldsymbol Y_w - \boldsymbol \Phi_w \boldsymbol C ,\\
\end{eqnarray}$$

where $$\boldsymbol Y_w = \boldsymbol W \boldsymbol Y$$ and $$\lVert . \rVert_F$$
is the [Frobenius Norm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html).
I have reused the symbol $$\rho_{WLS}$$ for the sum of the squared residuals, since this trivially contains eq.
$$\eqref{def-rwls}$$ as a special case for a dataset with only one member ($$S = 1$$).

Using the ideas of VarPro as presented in the previous article, we can rewrite 
minimization problem $$\eqref{min-rho-mrhs}$$ into a minimization 
over $$\boldsymbol \alpha$$ only:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
&\min_{\boldsymbol \alpha}& \boldsymbol \rho_{WLS}(\boldsymbol \alpha) \label{min-rho-mrhs-varpro} \tag{15} \\
\boldsymbol \rho_{WLS} (\boldsymbol \alpha) &=& \lVert \boldsymbol R_w (\boldsymbol \alpha) \rVert_F^2 \label{rho-varpro} \tag{16} \\
\boldsymbol R_w(\boldsymbol \alpha) &=& \boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w(\boldsymbol \alpha)} \boldsymbol Y_w \label{rw-varpro} \tag{17} \\
\end{eqnarray}$$

The matrix equations $$\eqref{rho-varpro},\eqref{rw-varpro}$$ are generalizations
of the vector identities $$\eqref{def-rwls}, \eqref{def-rw}$$. But there's
a problem that prevents us from just plugging these results into off-the-shelf
nonlinear least squares minimizers, as we did in the previous article.
The problem is, that those implementations usually require us to give the 
residual as one single vector. Additionally, we typically need to specify the
Jacobian matrix of that residual vector.

Luckily, all is not lost and we are not forced to resort to inefficient
approaches[^naive-approach] to shoehorn our nice matrix equations into vector format.
The residual $$\rho_{WLS}$$ in eq. $$\eqref{rho-varpro}$$ is just the squared
sum of the elements of the matrix $$\boldsymbol R_w$$. It's obvious that
$$\lVert \boldsymbol R_w (\boldsymbol \alpha) \rVert_F^2$$ is the same as the 
squared norm $$\lVert \boldsymbol z_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)\rVert_2^2$$ of a vector
$$\boldsymbol z_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)$$ defined as:

$$
\boldsymbol z_w(\boldsymbol \alpha) := \text{vec}\; \boldsymbol R_w (\boldsymbol \alpha) = 
\left(
\begin{matrix}
\boldsymbol r_{w,1} \\
\vdots \\
\boldsymbol r_{w,S} \\
\end{matrix}
\right) =
\left(
\begin{matrix}
\boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)} \boldsymbol y_{w,1}\\
\vdots \\
\boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)} \boldsymbol y_{w,S}\\
\end{matrix}
\right)
\in \mathbb{R}^{m\cdot S}. \label{z-vec} \tag{18}
$$

The mathematical operation $$\text{vec}$$ is called 
[vectorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization_(mathematics))[^caveat-vectorization]
and turns a matrix into a vector by stacking the matrix columns on top of each
other. We now obtained a vector that we can pass into our nonlinear minimization
step. We can use the matrix form of eq. $$\eqref{rw-varpro}$$ to calculate $$\boldsymbol z_w$$ and
then turn the resulting matrix into a vector by stacking the columns. Ideally,
this is a very cheap operation in our linear algebra backend.

The final piece of the puzzle is an expression for the Jacobian of $$\boldsymbol z_w(\boldsymbol \alpha)$$,
which we'll denote $$\boldsymbol J \{\boldsymbol z_w\}(\boldsymbol \alpha) \in \mathbb{R}^{m\cdot S\, \times \, q}$$.
It's $$k-th$$ column is, by definition, just

$$\boldsymbol j_k^{(z)} = \frac{\partial z_w}{\partial \alpha_k} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \cdot S},$$

which, using the same insights as above, we can write it as

$$\boldsymbol j_k^{(z)} = 
\left(
\begin{matrix}
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol r_{w,1} }{\partial \alpha_k} \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol r_{w,S} }{\partial \alpha_k} \\
\end{matrix}
\right) =
\left(
\begin{matrix}
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)}}{\partial \alpha_k} \boldsymbol y_{w,1}\\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)}}{\partial \alpha_k} \boldsymbol y_{w,S}\\
\end{matrix}
\right) = \text{vec} 
\left(
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)}}{\partial \alpha_k}
\boldsymbol Y_w
\right).
\label{jkz} \tag{19}
$$

The previous article shows how to calculate the matrix
$$\frac{\partial \boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w (\boldsymbol \alpha)}}{\partial \alpha_k}$$.
It's the same matrix as for a single right hand side.
Again, we can use the matrix form to efficiently calculate eq. $$\eqref{jkz}$$ and then
transform the matrix into a column vector. If we compare the equations for the
single right hand side $$\eqref{rw-P-y}, \eqref{jk}$$ with the equations for multiple
right hand sides $$\eqref{rw-varpro}, \eqref{jkz}$$, we can see that the matrix equations
are just pretty straightforward generalizations of the original vector identities.

# Advantages and Limitations

The presented approach to solving multiple right hand sides with variable
projection has many advantages. VarPro eliminates the linear parameters from
the nonlinear minimization process, which --together with the fact that the nonlinear
parameters are shared across the dataset-- means that instead of $$S\cdot n + q$$ parameters,
the nonlinear solver only has to solve for $$q$$ parameters. This is a
substantial reduction in parameters even for moderately sized datasets. Furthermore,
the matrix $$\boldsymbol P^\perp_{\boldsymbol \Phi_w(\boldsymbol \alpha)d}$$ and its derivative only need
to be calculated once for the whole dataset for a given value of $$\boldsymbol \alpha$$.
This can massively speed up the fit.

However, this comes at a price: the whole calculation that I presented here depends on
the fact that the same weights are applied to all members of the dataset, see eq. $$\eqref{weighted-data}$$.
This might not be as bad of a limitation as it sounds at first. Warrent _et al._
show that [it's pretty simple](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070687#s2)
to come up with decent global weights even for Poisson distributed data (Warren2013).

# Limitations and Extensions

I'll conclude this article here, since it is the simplest and most efficient
application of VarPro to problems with multiple right hand sides. Let me 
mention some limitations of the presented approach and how to overcome them, without
going into too much detail.

## Depending on the Data Index
One important limitation of the approach presented here is, that the model functions
and the weights must be the same for each member of the dataset, i.e. they may
not vary with the index $$s$$ across the dataset.
This limitation enables us to calculate the projection matrix and its derivative
only once for the whole dataset and brings us substantial computational savings.
It is pretty straightforward to extend the method presented here to allow a dependency
on $$s$$, cf. eg. (Baerligea2023). We will then need to 
recalculate the matrix $$\boldsymbol \Phi_w^{(s)}$$ for every index $$s$$, and likewise the
projection matrix and it's derivative. This will cost us some significant compute[^svd-product]
but can still beat a purely nonlinear minimization without VarPro (Baerligea2023).

## More Efficient Solvers

The methodology presented here assumes we want to plug our residual and Jacobian
into an existing nonlinear least squares solver. This has many advantages. For example,
in our implementation we can concentrate on the actual VarPro part and leave the
minimization to a well crafted third party library. We can also switch out the
minimization backend, by switching to a different library or exchanging the
underlying algorithm. Usually, VarPro implementations use the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)
algorithm for minimization, but any nonlinear least squares solver will do. BÃ¤rligea
actually presents some evidence that solvers other than LM can be more efficient 
for certain problems (Baerligea2023). 

However, there are some downsides that come with this approach. One problem is
that both the residual vector and the Jacobian matrix will have $$m\cdot S$$ rows,
which can become quite large for big datasets. In their paper, Warren _et al._
report an approach termed _partitioned variable projection_ that implements
a modified version of the LM solver, which does not require to store the full
Jacobian (Warren2013).

# Endnotes

[^baerligea-extension]: They extend the method for datasets where the members of a dataset may have different numbers of elements. This is out of scope for this here article because we have to sacrifice computational savings for this extension. However, it's definitely worth checking out their paper. 
[^naive-approach]: If you're interested, check out the section titled _naive approach_ in the BÃ¤rligea paper.
[^caveat-vectorization]: Not to be confused with the concept of _vectorization_ in programming.
[^svd-product]: _Maybe_ [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/67231/singular-value-decomposition-of-product-of-matrices) could help for the case where only the weights vary with $$s$$. But I'm not so sure...
[^slight-changes]: They use the term _dataset_ instead of _right hand side_ in their definition, but I am going to use the term dataset slightly differently. So that is why I changed it to right hand side.
[^lifetimes]: Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging ([FLIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence-lifetime_imaging_microscopy)) requires us to fit a number of lifetimes (the nonlinear parameters) from a  multiexponential decay, with varying amplitudes of the individual exponential decays (the linear coefficients). It is a reasonable approximation that only a  handful of distinct lifetimes are present in any one particular sample (corresponding  to different fluorophores), but that the linear coefficients (corresponding to  fluorophore concentration) might vary spatially across a sample (Warren2013).  However, it is _also_ well known that the fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore depends on it's chemical surroundings, among other things. So the most likely scenario is that both the concentration as well as the lifetimes actually change across a sample. However, exponential fitting is a notoriously ill conditioned problem and the change in lifetime might or might not be detectable within the accuracy of the fit. At the end of the day, it's a decision that must be made based on our knowledge of the data. Also consider the principle that ["all models are wrong, but some are useful"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong).
